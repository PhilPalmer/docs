# docs :books:

## Motivation
I make a lot of notes and often find myself referring back to programming commands etc. I figured I will store them here & open-source them. This is for three main purposeses:
1) To help me retain the things I learn
2) A central place to store & refer back to notes
3) For other people to use on the small chance that they may be useful for others

## About me
I am currently working as a bioinfomatician and so currently they mainly focus on programming using languages such as [Nextflow](https://www.nextflow.io/) & [Docker](https://www.docker.com/). I hope to learn and add more on topics such as web development, data science and beyond in the future though
